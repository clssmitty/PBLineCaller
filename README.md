# PickleBall Line Caller
A tool for determining if a pickleball is in or out of bounds.

Currently, there is a Google Colab notebook for exploring line and ball detection using a YOLO model trained and hosted on Roboflow. 

The goal is to build an app that allows for a distributed set of phones to do line and ball detection for automatically making line calls during a pickleball match. This is just the beginning.
